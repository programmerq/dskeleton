Django-Skeleton
===============

This is my usual Django project layout after I do a ``django-admin.py
startproject``, and before I do anything else. I've commented out the apps that
aren't part of Django:
`django-webalizer <http://github.com/arneb/django-webalizer/>`__ and
`django-export <http://github.com/arneb/django-export/>`__. Feel free to use
this. What I do is clone the repo, remove the origin remote, rename the repo
itself, and develop from there.
